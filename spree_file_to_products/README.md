File To Products
===================

The extension adds the ability to load products from a file to the admin panel (only csv format is currently supported).

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:
  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_file_to_products', github: 'spark_test_task-master/spree_file_to_products'
  ```

2. Install the gem using Bundler:
  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

3. Copy & run migrations
  ```ruby
  bundle exec rails g spree_file_to_products:install
  ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake

rake test_app

cd spec/dummy
rake db:schema:load
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_file_to_products/factories'
```
